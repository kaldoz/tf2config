Thanks for installing my mod!

I'll cut to the chase and inform you of a few things.

//////////////////////
//// INSTALLATION ////
//////////////////////

Go to your "Team Fortress 2/tf/custom" folder and drop in the VPK.

That's it! I've also put in a folder so that you can play around/delete or add textures to your liking.

Please note that you don't need both files inside custom, having either one is already enough.

//////////////////////
//// INFORMATION /////
//////////////////////

If you are using the "FlatTexturesV2" version, you have to do a few steps
in order to get the characters and weapons flat.


////FOR MASTERCOMFIG USERS///:

If you are using Mastercomfig, the way to preload is a bit tricky.

To preload with Mastercomfig, go to your Team Fortress 2/tf/cfg folder.
In your cfg folder, create a folder called "user" (only if you don't already have it)
Go into that "user" folder and create a "modules.cfg" file (if you don't have it and don't know how to make one, you can copy an already existing .cfg file and rename it to "modules")
Open it up with a text editor and paste in this command here: "dynamic_background=itemtest" (without quotation marks, obviously)

And you should be all good to go!





///FOR OTHER / NO CONFIG USERS////:

Other config users have it way easier.

All you need to do is go into your Team Fortress 2/tf/cfg folder.
In there, open up "autoexec.cfg" (or create/copy one if it doesn't exist)
add in this line of code in there: "map itemtest;wait 5; disconnect" (without quotation marks, obviously)

And you should be all good to go!




//////////////////////
//  TROUBLESHOOTING //
//////////////////////

Q: The world is not flat at all! it looks very grainy and looks repeated!

A: This problem may occur if your texture quality setting is set higher than low. I mean come on,
you probably downloaded this mod because your computer is bad or you want no distractions, so I don't know why you would even have it higher than low.
Another reason why it could be grainy is because of what your texture filtering command is set to. Try either setting this command to 0 or 1.
"mat_filtertextures"




Q: I downloaded FlatTexturesV2 but neither the players nor the weapons are flat!

A: A few reasons why that might be the case is because you either skipped / did something wrong in the preloading process or you're using an AMD graphics card.
it might also be because you're using linux or something. I never tried it out myself on linux so I honestly don't know how you would fix it in that platform.
To (possibly) fix this issue on AMD cards, you might need to do LOD tweakings too. To find out how, you can do the steps shown in this video (Use at your own risk) : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdqdpzlsBSk




Q: My game crashes whenever I join a server, what's going on?!

A: This is probably because there are conflicting mods in your custom folder. If you have a mod that replaces a texture, delete it before using this mod.




Q: Would I get VAC banned for using this?!

A: lmao no




Q: Is Valve going to fix this?!

A: No. Valve does not care about this anyways. They're not going to patch it out.
They've been ignoring us for years now. You know about custom viewmodel animations, right?
They work on casual when you preload. Preloading is not an intended thing, it's a sv_pure 2 bypass, essentially.
And just like the viewmodel animations, flat textures are purely aesthetics. If they cared about the game, they would also patch out custom viewmodel animations too.




Q: It's still not working! Is there anything else I could do?!

A: If all else fails, feel free to add and ask me in discord, flewvar#5252.
if the discord is unavailable, add me on steam, flewvar. I'm the only one that comes up so it shouldn't be too hard to find me.
(please note that I always go trough temporary alias changes so don't be surprised when my name on steam is something obscure)

If you wanna stream / do videos with this mod, please go ahead. But be sure to credit JarateKing for finding out how to do this in the first place,
I could not have done this without all his hard works.

# tf2config
im saving my config here for the future

//kaldoz's cfg 

hey man whatsup just download the cfg and custom file and just replace them in your own /tf folder for tf2
I actually use venomcrosshair which is custom crosshair(inside the custom folder) so if you feel like it you can use a custom crosshair you like
sniper rifle viewmodel looks like its long and weridly thin cause of the horsieViewmodelEditor(in custom also) , so if you hate how it looks just delete it.

hud in use is arekkhud
